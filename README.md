# HTML & CSS Practice

This repository contains several small HTML and CSS mini-projects created while practicing fundamental web development concepts.
Each project focuses on a different layout, styling technique, or page structure.

The projects are simple, beginner-friendly exercises meant to build confidence with:

- Semantic HTML
- Basic CSS styling
- Layouts with floats, flexbox or grid (depending on project)
- Responsive adjustments
- Working with images, typography, and page structure

### 3. CSS Flexbox Practice
This mini-project is focused on **CSS Flexbox** layout techniques.  
It demonstrates how to use flex containers and flex items to create flexible, responsive layouts.  

**Key concepts:**
- `display: flex` to create a flex container
- `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` to control item flow
- `justify-content` and `align-items` to align items horizontally and vertically
- `order` to change the visual order of items
- `flex` and `flex-basis` to control item size and proportion

The project includes **three containers** with multiple boxes, showcasing different flex layouts and responsive behaviour.
More mini-projects will be added as practice continues.
